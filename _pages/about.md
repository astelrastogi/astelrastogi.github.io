I am a graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity. My interests lie at the intersection of **Software and Network Security and Privacy, Cloud Computing, Game Development, and Algorithms.**

I am currently working as a graduate teaching assistant for the CSE 545 - Software Security course at Arizona State University under [Dr. Erik Trickel](https://www.trickel.com/). I interned at Amazon Web Services, Elastic Map Reduce Serverless team during the summer of 2024, where I developed an interactive portal for the team that delivered critical insights into Spark and Hive job
performance, facilitating troubleshooting efforts, and reducing investigation times by 25% on average. 


I am always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out to me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastha-rastogi/).
